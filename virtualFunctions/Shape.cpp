/*
Create a base class called shape. Use this class to store two
double type values that could be used to compute the area of figures.
Derive two specific classes called triangle and rectangle from base
shape. Add to the base class , a member function get_data() to
initialize base class data members and another member function
display_area() to compute and display the area of figures.
Make display_area() as a virtual function and redefine this function
in the derived class to suit their requirements. Using these three
classes, design a program that will accept dimensions of a triangle
or a rectangle interactively and display the area.
Remember the two values given as input will be treated as lengths
of two sides in the case of rectangles and as base and height in the
case of triangle and used as follows:
Area of rectangle = x * y
Area of triangle = Â½ *x*y
